# 1.Expert Interview

We collaborated closely with two power system experts and summarized their usage and feedback.

## 1.1 The Procedure

Both  experts were invited to the interview. Each of them participated for two hours. The interview started by a brief introduction of the visual design and interaction design in our visual interface (0.5 hour). Then we demonstrated the case in Section 4.3 and they followed our instructions to explore the case (0.5 hour). Afterward, we provided half an hour of free exploration (0.5 hour) and ended the interview by collecting their feedbacks for half an hour (0.5 hour).

## 1.2 The Feedbacks

After the free exploration, we interviewed the experts. We summarized their feedbacks from the following perspectives: general justification, usability, limitations and suggestions.

### 1.2.1 General Justification

Both experts confirmed the contribution to the power system research. As mentioned by one expert, "Identifying threatening oscillation modes helps us take effective measures to protect the power system and keep its stability. The tradition way to identify oscillation modes is frequency domain analysis, which is time-consuming. Your tool provides a more direct and efficient solution. Now I can identify interested oscillation modes on a few images and automatically annotate all other images.".

The other expert also mentioned, "In real-world power system operation, operators rely only on chart images to identify problems. That's exactly your tool can do.".

### 1.2.2 Usability

According to the experts, the usability of our visual interface exists in the following two aspects. First, our interface supports to identify important modes in an image, which could be covered by other modes. As mentioned by one expert, "In the visual interface, I can decompose an individual image into multiple modes. This helps me identify the overall oscillation mode that are always covered by other more severe modes and are originally difficult to discover.".

Second, by interacting with the interface, we combines experience from domain experts and assures we only discover interested and meaningful insights. As mentioned by the other expert, "In power system operation, we are only interested in more threatening oscillation modes. Therefore, I can avoid useless insights by making selections in the interface.".

### 1.2.3 Limitations and Suggestions

During the interview, the experts also mentioned the limitations of our interface and provided valuable suggestions. First, it can be difficult for them to identify insights if the images are not well organized, for example, the order of the buses are disrupted. Therefore, an automatic insight  suggestion method should be provided. Second, they not only need to identify threatening oscillation modes, but also need to know their threatening level. Therefore, a threat assessment method is expected to be involved.
